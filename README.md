Generate data points around a function.

**3/18/24 One Day Project** - I originally made a basic plotter in python using matplotlib and numpy to generate some data points for a physics class and found it to be quite useful so I turned it into a website so I could share it with people who may want to use it.

It can be used to generate anticipated data values based on a prediction or visualize the trajectory of points, such as tracking the movement of a projectile through the air.

# USE

1. Input a function 
    1. Only elementary functions are allowed (has to be legal for parse_expr method) 
2. Enter Standard Deviation (variation) and Number of points (equally spaced data points) 
3. Define boundaries of the function based on bounds (X Min, Y Min, X Max, Y Max)
4. Generate the Data
    1. Export as CSV 
    2. Export as TXT 

*ok bye! dont use it to fabricate all ur lab data lol*
